# Review any GitHub PR with ChatGPT/4

You can ask our ChatGPT/4 bots to review ANY public Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/flows-network/review-any-pr-with-chatgpt/issues/new) in this repo
2. Put in the full URL of the PR you want to review as the `Title`. [See an example](https://github.com/flows-network/review-any-pr-with-chatgpt/issues/7)
3. Click on the "Submit new issue" button!

The first comment in the issue will be [a review of all changed files in the PR](https://github.com/flows-network/review-any-pr-with-chatgpt/issues/7#issuecomment-1522522484).

You can also summon the bot to [summarize the PR by commits](https://github.com/flows-network/review-any-pr-with-chatgpt/issues/7#issuecomment-1522525810) by leaving a [flows summarize](https://github.com/flows-network/review-any-pr-with-chatgpt/issues/7#issuecomment-1522525775) message in the comment.

## To use the bots in your own projects

You can customize and deploy the two PR code review bots on your project repo. For example, the bot could be triggered whenever a new PR is raised in your repo, and the review comment is updated whenever there is a new commit in the PR.

* Use the [summarize by commits](https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-summary) bot.
* Use the [review by changed files](https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-review) bot.

Happy coding!
